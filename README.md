# Twitter Bot
The purpose of this bot is to automatically reply to tweets that mention your account and include a trigger phrase
(specified in the TAG variable). In this example, I have created a fictional account that responds to mentions followed by
the phrase "data de hoje" (which means "today's date" in Portuguese) by providing the corresponding day of the week, day of
the month, month, and year.
